There’s a very thin line between a nostalgic experience and an archaic one, and it’s a line that Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War's Multiplayer has not quite managed to balance on. It feels like an old-school shooter at times which sometimes feels great but all too rarely, with simple map designs and underwhelming additions to playlists failing to hit the mark. If you’re looking for a quick burst of fun multiplayer action then there’s just about enough here to keep you entertained for an evening, but not much more than that. With some weapon balancing on the way and hopefully more maps and modes available in the future, there will be more to enjoy in Cold War’s multiplayer; I just can’t see it taking my time away from Modern Warfare or Warzone anytime soon.
